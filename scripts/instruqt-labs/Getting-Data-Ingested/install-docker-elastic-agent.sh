====================================================================
Elastic Agent (Synthetics) Docker Container Installation Complete!
====================================================================

You have just installed the Elastic Agent using the 'elastic-agent-complete:8.18.1' Docker image.
This containerized agent allows you to run **synthetic browser monitors** directly on your host.

Details of what was done:
- The **enrollment token** you provided was used to securely register your agent with Fleet.
- The Docker network **'elastic'** was created (if it did not already exist) to allow the agent to communicate with other Elastic stack containers.
- The container was given the name **Elastic-Agent-Synthetics** for easy identification.
- The **--restart=always** option ensures your agent container will **restart automatically** if your machine reboots or if the container crashes, keeping your monitoring consistent.
- The Elastic Agent connects to **https://fleet-server-agent-http.default.svc:8220**, so make sure your Fleet Server is running and accessible at that address.

You can check the agentâ€™s status with:
  docker logs -f Elastic-Agent-Synthetics

To remove the agent:
  docker rm -f Elastic-Agent-Synthetics
